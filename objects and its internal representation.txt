3. name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties.

In arr we can store the multiple values in organised  manner .
let arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,];

1.the value in array are stored in for of index value and let arr is the variable memory location that stored .
2. values in arr can access using the index value 0 is 1, index of 1 is 2, index of 2 is 3 so on.
3.we can change the value of an array using assigning the new value to index 0.
example:
arr[0]=2;
